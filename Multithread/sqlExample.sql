â€” From the terminal command line, shut down any existing copy of SQL:
-- sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin shutdown
 
-- Bring up a new copy of the mysql server:
-- sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe
-- Hit control-Z to stop the process you just started
-- Type in the following to make mysql a background process:
-- bg
-- You now have the mysql server running in the background

-- Start a console to your mysql server:
-- /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root

-- You are now in a mysql client and can issues the following

select * from timeStamps;

-- Create a table of NULL price records for all ids - These are records that fall exactly on the
-- time stamps we're interested in but contain a value of NULL. We can do this by joining unique
-- stock ids with the above table of bucket boundary time stamps

drop table results2;
